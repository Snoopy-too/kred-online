# KRED - Official Game Rules

> *You can't trust anyone, not even yourself!*

All is not how it appears in the world of KRED, the game of honesty, deception, cooperation and self-serving skullduggery for 3 to 5 wily, cunning, and unscrupulous players. The motto being: **As long as you don't get caught, anything goes!** Turn a blind eye to an opponent's lies in one move, expose their corrupt Machiavellian ways the next.

But remember, this is no place for law-abiding citizens: if you reckon you can win without bluffing, bribing, or downright lying your way to the top, you've got another think coming. You can't trust anyone, not even yourself!

In a series of Campaigns, players compete against each other to be the first to install a Pawn in their Office, put Heels in their Rostrums, and fill their Seats. There may be rules, but you will be aiming to flout them whenever it may give you an advantage. And despite what some might say, you're only in it for yourself.

The one who finally succeeds will have done the best job of deceiving and manipulating the others while ensuring, when the time is right to do so, that their opponent's deceits are ruthlessly exposed.

## Glossary

### Game Pieces

- **A Heel** - Leadership pieces (12 for 3-player, 16 for 4-player, 20 for 5-player)
- **A Mark** - Supporter pieces (9 for 3-player, 12 for 4-player, 15 for 5-player)
- **A Pawn** - One per player
- **Pieces** - The collective term for Marks, Heels, and Pawns

### Board Locations

- **A Domain** - Each player area incorporating 1 Office, 2 Rostrums, 6 Seats, and 2 Factions
- **The Office** - The large space with a blue star, where the Pawn is aiming to sit
- **A Rostrum** - One of the 2 brown, triangular spaces below the Office
- **A Seat** - There are 6 of these below the 2 rostrums and adjacent to the Community
- **A Faction** - This consists of a Rostrum and its 3 connecting seats
- **The Community** - The Marks, Heels, and Pawns in the center of the board from which players will draw and return pieces throughout the game

### Player Areas

- **The Accept Line** - The area in front of each player where accepted Tiles await Challenges
- **The Bank** - The area in front of each player where played Tiles are placed

**Note**: Rostrums and Seats of 5-player board become The Bank in a 4-player game and vice versa.

### Game Terms

- **A Campaign** - The phase of the game where tiles are played and pieces are moved
- **Bureaucracy** - The phase of the game where players use funding to take various actions
- **An Honest Move** - Moving the pieces in accordance with what is indicated on the tile played
- **A Dishonest Move** - Moving the pieces in accordance with what is indicated on one of the existing game tiles, but not the tile that was actually played
- **Illegal** - A play that is not indicated on any existing game tile (ignoring the blank tile)
- **Credibility Token** - Notched triangular pieces used to keep track of each player's credibility
- **A Tile** - The rectangular pieces used that display various moves and funding
- **Funding** - The value on each tile that might be used during the Bureaucracy phase

---

## Objective

The objective is to be the first player to have:
- Either a Mark or a Heel in all **6 Seats**
- A Heel in each **Rostrum** (both)
- A Pawn in the **Office**

Pieces are advanced by playing tiles in the Campaign phase, or by using funding during the Bureaucracy phase. A winning set-up will not be achieved by making only Honest moves, so be prepared to do whatever you must to defeat your opponents!

---

## Game Setup

### Initial Piece Placement

At the beginning of the game, a Mark is placed in every other Seat (starting from the left). All remaining pieces are placed in the Community.

**Player Count Configurations:**

- **3-Player Setup**: 12 Marks, 9 Heels, 3 Pawns
- **4-Player Setup**: 16 Marks, 12 Heels, 4 Pawns
- **5-Player Setup**: 20 Marks, 15 Heels, 5 Pawns

### Tile Drafting

The Tiles are shuffled face-down and dealt evenly among players:
- **3-player game**: 8 tiles each
- **4-player game**: 6 tiles each
- **5-player game**: 5 tiles each (includes blank tile)

Players look at their Tiles, select one to keep and pass the rest to the player on their left. Repeat this step until all tiles have been claimed. **This process is done only once, at the beginning of the game.** It is not repeated at the beginning of any subsequent Campaigns.

---

## How the Pieces Move

### Advance
This action may be used to add one Mark from the Community to one of your vacant Seats. Only if there are no Marks left in the Community may this action be used to add a Heel from the Community to a vacant Seat.

Once all 3 Seats of a Faction are occupied, this action may instead be used to advance one of those 3 pieces to their corresponding Rostrum. If both Rostrums of a Domain are occupied, this action may also be used to advance a piece from a Rostrum to the Office.

### Assist
This action may be used to add one Mark from the Community to one of your Opponent's vacant Seats. Again, if there are no Marks left in the Community this action may be used to add a Heel from the Community to an opponent's vacant Seat.

### Withdraw
This action may be used to either:
- **A)** Withdraw a piece from one of your Seats back to the Community
- **B)** Move a piece from one of your Rostrums down to a vacant Seat
- **C)** Move a piece from your Office down to one of your vacant Rostrums

### Remove
This action may be used to Remove one Mark from any of your Opponent's Seats to the Community. This action does not allow you to 'Withdraw' any of your opponent's pieces from Rostrums or Offices. **Pawns and Heels may never be Removed to the Community.**

### Organize
This action may be used to move one of your pieces one space to the left or right. Movement between Rostrums is not possible. However, it is possible for a player to transfer their own piece to an adjacent player's Rostrum or Seat.

### Influence
This action may be used to move one of your opponent's Marks or Heels one space to the left or right. Moving pieces between Domains, including into your own, is permissible. However, **a Pawn may not be Influenced into or out of any Domain.**

### Important Movement Rules

- **If a piece occupies a Rostrum in any Faction where no Seats are occupied**, that piece must immediately be moved down to a Seat of that player's choice in the corresponding faction. Likewise, if a piece occupies any player's Office while neither of their Rostrums are occupied, that piece must also be immediately moved down to a Rostrum of that player's choice.

- **When making two moves in a turn**, they may be done in any order. However, they must affect separate pieces. For example, you cannot Influence another player's piece into your domain and then Advance or Withdraw the same piece. Nor can you give another player a piece and then Influence that same piece into your own domain.

## The Campaign

### The Play

At the beginning of each Campaign, the player with the "0" tile becomes the first "Mover". It is not required that they play the "0" tile on their first turn. The Mover moves any one or two pieces according to the "How the pieces move" section.

Then, the Mover places one of their tiles face-down in front of any player they choose. This will be the "Receiver". **It is not required that the pieces are moved in exact accordance to what is on the tile played.** The Mover may make any Honest or Dishonest play, but they may not make an Illegal play. Passing the tile indicates that the Mover is finished.

**Important Notes:**
- The Receiver must have at least one tile in order to continue play. The only time a player is allowed to be both the Mover and Receiver is if they are the only player left with a tile to continue with.
- If a player has no remaining tiles, choose another player to be the receiver (yourself if you must).

### The Receipt

If the Receiver has no remaining Credibility, skip to 'The Challenge'.

If the Receiver does have any remaining Credibility, they may look at the tile. If the tile matches the move(s) made, the Receiver will place the tile face-down next to their Accept line. If the tile does not match the move(s) that were made, the Receiver has two choices:

1. **Accept**: Place the tile face-down next to their area of the board, as if it were an Honest play, or
2. **Expose**: Turn the tile face-up to expose the Dishonest play

#### If the Receiver Exposes a Dishonest Play:

- The Receiver restores up to 2 notches on their Credibility token. (If they already have full credibility, however, they may take a free Advance action.)
- The tile is then placed face-up in their Bank and is **not counted towards their funding** during that campaign's Bureaucracy
- The Mover returns the dishonestly moved pieces to their original positions and then makes the play exactly as per the tile played
- The Mover then also loses 1 notch of Credibility

**Important Notes:**
- If the Receiver has no Credibility left, they may not look at or even touch the tile except to discard it or reveal it when challenged by another player. If the move is shown to be Dishonest, the Receiver may keep the funding.
- If the Receiver does have credibility, they may accept the tile without actually looking at it by simply placing it along the Accept line.

### The Challenge

After a tile has been accepted by the Receiver and laid face-down next to their area, players with Credibility still remaining (in clockwise order from the receiver) have the opportunity to challenge the veracity of the play.

**If all players accept the play:**
- The Receiver simply puts the tile face-down in their bank to be counted during Bureaucracy
- The Receiver then becomes the next Mover and continues play

**If any player challenges the play**, the tile is turned over for all to see.

#### If the Play Was Honest:

- The Mover restores 1 notch on their Credibility token (If they had no Credibility at the start of that turn, they do not restore Credibility)
- The Challenger loses 1 notch on their Credibility token
- The Receiver puts the tile in their Bank face-down to be counted during Bureaucracy but does not restore any credibility or gain anything other than the funding on the Tile

#### If the Play Was Dishonest:

- The Mover returns the dishonestly moved pieces to their original positions, and then makes the play exactly as per the tile played
- The Mover then also loses 1 notch of Credibility (If they had no Credibility at the start of that turn, they must instead take a Withdraw action)
- The Challenger restores 1 notch on their Credibility token (if possible). (If the Challenger started with perfect credibility, they gain only vindication in calling out their opponent)
- The Receiver loses 1 notch on their Credibility token (if possible), and puts the Tile in their Bank face-up. **This tile will not count towards funding** during that round's Bureaucracy

**Important Notes:**
- Players with no Credibility may not challenge. They may, however, cry foul for any move(s) not described in the "How the Pieces Move" section as it would break the rules of the game.
- In rare cases where the Mover must play to themselves at the end of the Campaign - if they are challenged - they lose credibility but keep the funding.
- If one or both of the actions on a tile are impossible due to the current state of the board, such actions may be forgone and the play will still be considered honest if challenged.

### The Blank Tile (5-Player Only)

The blank tile is used in a 5-player game so that all players get an equal number of tiles. When this tile is played:
- The Receiver will have no choice but to accept
- Any legal move will be considered honest
- If challenged, the Challenger will incur one notch on their credibility and the Mover will restore one
- **The blank tile cannot be used to achieve a winning setup**

---

## Credibility

Each player has a "Credibility Token" to indicate their level of trustworthiness. At the beginning of the game, this should be placed so that the smooth edge is uppermost indicating full Credibility.

### Credibility Levels
- **Full Credibility** (Starting Position)
- **One Notch Lost**
- **Two Notches Lost**
- **No Credibility**

### Losing Credibility

A player will incur one notch on their Credibility Token for each of the following:

1. As the Mover, their play is refused by the Receiver or challenged by another player and shown to have been dishonest
2. As the Receiver, they accept a play and a subsequent challenge shows it to have been dishonest
3. As a Challenger, the play they are challenging is shown to have been honest

### Effects of Losing All Credibility

If any player's Credibility incurs a third penalty, they must turn their Credibility token on end to indicate that they have lost all credibility. This means:

- They may no longer restore notches on their credibility until the Bureaucracy Phase
- They may not challenge any opponent's play until they restore at least one notch (during the Bureaucracy Phase)
- They may not look at a tile they are given unless it is challenged by another player
- If caught making a Dishonest play, they will be required to take one Withdraw action

### Restoring Credibility

A player may restore **one notch** on their Credibility Token for each of the following:

1. As the Mover, their play is challenged and subsequently shown to have been honest
2. As the Receiver, they have exactly one notch on their credibility and expose a dishonest play
3. As a Challenger, the play that they challenge is subsequently shown to have been dishonest

A player may restore **two notches** on their Credibility Token only when, as the Receiver, they have exactly two notches on their credibility and refuse a dishonest play. If the Receiver refuses a dishonest play when there are no notches on their credibility, they may instead take one Advance action.

---

## Bureaucracy

At the end of each Campaign, players add up the total of all the face-down tiles they have to determine their available funding and then announce that number.

**Note**: The sum of all of the numbers announced combined with the sum of the face-up tiles should add up to exactly 100.

### Turn Order

The player with the highest available funding goes first, with the remaining players going in descending order of available funds. In the event of a tie:
1. Any player with a Pawn goes first
2. If both players (or neither) have a Pawn, the player with the most Heels goes first
3. Then the most Marks
4. Finally, the most Credibility

### Available Actions

Each player may use their available funding for any of the actions listed below that they can afford. The number of Marks or Heels a player may gain during their turn is limited only by their available funding and the number of available pieces. **But each player may only ever have one Pawn.**

| 3P Cost | 4P Cost | Action | 5P Cost |
|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| 18 | 18 | Promote any piece in the Office one time (a Mark to a Heel, or a Heel to a Pawn) | 12 |
| 15 | 15 | Take 1 Assist, Remove or Influence action | 10 |
| 12 | 12 | Promote a piece at a Rostrum one time (a Mark to a Heel, or a Heel to a Pawn) | 8 |
| 9 | 9 | Take 1 Advance, Withdraw or Organize action | 6 |
| 6 | 6 | Promote a piece in a Seat one time (a Mark to a Heel, or a Heel to a Pawn) | 4 |
| 3 | 3 | Restore one notch on your Credibility token (even if it has been completely lost) | 2 |

After Bureaucracy has been completed, players turn all their tiles face-down and take them out of their Bank. The player with the "0" tile begins the next Campaign.

---

## Winning the Game

The game is won by the player who has:
- Either a Mark or a Heel in all 6 Seats
- A Heel in each Rostrum
- A Pawn in the Office

This can be achieved at two possible points in the game:

1. **During the Campaign phase**, when any challenges to the winning play have been resolved
2. **At the end of the Bureaucracy phase** when all players have made their moves and used up their available funding

**If two or more players simultaneously have a winning setup in either of these situations, the game ends in a draw for all players.**

**Note**: In a 5 player game, the blank tile cannot be used to achieve a winning setup.

## Strategy & Important Notes

### And finally... Is that even possible, Sam?

Some things that may be worth remembering. Or not, as the case may be.

There are many different strategies and tactics in this game and, of course, bluffing comes in all shapes and sizes. Suffice to say, **never take anything at face value**. Just because your opponent looks like you couldn't throw them as far as you could trust them, they just might be as honest as the day is long. Credibility, or lack thereof, cuts both ways!

And just because the tile you receive doesn't match the move the player made, you don't have to admit it straightaway. Think of the funding in Bureaucracy - did they bung you enough? But don't think for too long, or your opponents might expose you as the bribe-taking scallywag that you are. Unless, of course, the move was honest. Then you might delay as much as you like, and lure the unsuspecting Challenger into losing their credibility.

**As the saying goes - Don't believe half of what you see, and none of what you hear!**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why isn't the receiver rewarded for accepting an honest move? After all, they're doing a good thing.

**A:** Because that is what they should be doing. Should you get a pat on the back every time you don't steal something from a shop?

### Q: I've just got a winning set-up half-way through Bureaucracy. Game over?

**A:** Not so fast! The game is only over if the winning set-up still exists when every player has finished their Bureaucracy.

### Q: It's the last tile of the Campaign. The Mover and Receiver are the same player. Is this ok?

**A:** Yes, but probably something that should be avoided. Keep an eye on who has tiles and who should be given tiles during the Campaign.

### Q: Someone made an illegal move. I know it's illegal because there's no tile with that play on it. But I don't have any credibility left, what can I do?!

**A:** You can call it out. Everybody, regardless of their credibility, position in the game, and/or in society as a whole, has the right to expose illegality.

## House Rules (Optional)

Our lawyers have advised that in the following contentious situations players should probably agree house rules before beginning the game:

1. What should we do with a player who makes an illegal move?
2. The move was honest but the Receiver turned the tile face-up. Should we punish them?
3. The move was dishonest and the Receiver, while having no credibility left, exposed it as such. They should probably not even have touched the tile! Can we flay them alive and feed their skin to the cat?
4. A player has lost all their credibility and is required to take a Withdraw action. They don't want to, and neither do the other players. Can we just let them off?

Depending on your preference for the ultimate cut-throat experience, or a more lenient and understanding approach to the failings of your fellow human beings, the punishments, if any, for the above infringements we feel should be left to the discretion of the players themselves. We thank you for your understanding.

## Important Reminder

**Please remember, what happens on the pitch stays on the pitch. No hard feelings, and don't argue too much. Friendships are too precious to throw away over such trifles.**

**Enjoy!**
